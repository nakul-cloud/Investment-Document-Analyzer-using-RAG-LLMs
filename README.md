# 📊 Investment Document Analyzer using RAG & LLMs

An **AI-powered system** that enables users to query large investment documents (such as prospectuses and financial reports) and receive **accurate, context-aware answers** using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.

This project reduces manual document analysis effort by combining **OCR, semantic embeddings, vector search (FAISS), and Large Language Models (LLMs)**.
